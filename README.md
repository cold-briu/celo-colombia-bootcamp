### 🎯 Purpose

The **Celo DeFi Builder Bootcamp** is a focused, high-impact learning experience designed to transition junior Web2 developers from Colombia into active Celo ecosystem builders. This regional focus is supported by the **Celo Colombia** community and leverages the **cCOP stablecoin** for incentives, rewards, and in-course transactions. The program is designed specifically for university students, bootcamp grads, and early-career engineers. All live sessions are delivered in UTC-5 to suit Colombia/México time zones.

### 🧩 What It Is

A 5-session, cohort-based online bootcamp that equips React/TypeScript developers with foundational Web3 and DeFi skills, using **Celo-native tools**, **GitHub**, and **Proof of Ship** from Day 1. Each learner builds and submits 4 small, functional DeFi projects—publicly tracked and documented.

### 🔗 GitHub-First, Code-Centric Learning

* No slides. No Gitbook. Everything lives in a GitHub repo.
* Students submit pull requests for every milestone.
* Course instructions, feedback, and demos all happen in code.
* The bootcamp itself is a project on Karma GAP—visible, verifiable, and forkable.

### 🛠️ Proof of Ship & Karma GAP Integration

From Session 1, learners:

* Create a Karma GAP project to track submissions
* Submit each week’s project as a milestone via GitHub PRs
* Mint a Proof of Ship Soulbound Token upon completion
* Build a public, verifiable portfolio that supports future grant applications

### 🪴 Long-Term Impact

Graduates of this LATAM-focused program:

* Apply for Celo grants with live projects
* Join Celo Colombia, cCOP, and DeFi DAOs
* Serve as peer mentors for the next cohort

### 📚 Bootcamp Delivery & Session Outline

Each session is delivered live online and is 2 hours long. The format is 80% hands-on coding and 20% guided walkthrough. Learners work directly in GitHub repositories, submitting pull requests for feedback and review.

#### Session Overview:

* **Session 1: Hello Celo + Proof of Ship Setup**
  Deploy a HelloCelo contract and register a Karma GAP project.

* **Session 2: Time-Locked Vault**
  Build and test a smart contract that locks CELO or cUSD with UI.

* **Session 3:cCOP Multi-Sig Wallet Frontend**
  Deploy a simple smart contract wallet that requires multiple signers to approve cCOP transfers.

* **Session 4: Uniswap LP Dashboard**
  Visualize pool data using Uniswap SDK and viem on Celo.

This outline is designed to offer continuous wins, real-world tooling exposure, and public portfolio building through Proof of Ship.

### 📦 Deliverables

The program produces tangible outputs that demonstrate learner progress and ecosystem alignment, including a public-facing website for discoverability and open education:

#### Instructor Deliverables:

* Weekly office-hour schedule shared via Google Calendar
* Static website hosting the full course outline, project templates, toolchain links, and FAQ
* GitHub repos for each session with starter code and issue templates
* Bootcamp project on Karma GAP with milestone tracking
* Recap content and coordination of Twitter Space finale

#### Learner Deliverables:

* Post-bootcamp satisfaction and next-steps survey
* Personal Karma GAP project page with 5 public milestone submissions
* GitHub PRs for all weekly projects
* Participation in Twitter Space recap and community engagement

### 🗓️ Timeline Overview

The full program spans **10 weeks**, segmented into three phases:

* **Weeks –3 to 0: Preparation Phase**

  * Curriculum drafting, outreach, GitHub setup, and Karma GAP project configuration

* **Weeks 1 to 5: Live Instruction Phase**

  * Weekly 2-hour live sessions with progressive project builds and public submissions

* **Week 6: Final Showcase & Support Phase**

  * Final project milestone submission, Twitter Space recap chat with community and mentors, async feedback, and onboarding to grants and advanced tracks

This bootcamp sets in motion a repeatable, scalable model for nurturing Web3 builders in LATAM.

### 📈 Metrics & Long-Term Impact

* KPIs: Learners per cohort, GitHub PRs merged, grant applications submitted
* Alumni Engagement: Ongoing Telegram chat for graduates and creation of an alumni directory/database to support continued collaboration and mentorship
